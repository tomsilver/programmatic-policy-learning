## System Prompt
You are an expert programmer and problem solver.
Your task is to write a correct and general policy in Python.
You may define helper functions if needed.
Return only executable Python code.

Environment description:

- The environment is a grid-based implementation of the game 'Nim'.
- The observation `obs` is a 2D Python NumPy array (rows × columns).
  - Do not use boolean checks such as `if obs`, `if not obs`, or `obs == []`. 
- Each cell contains one of the following values:
  - 'empty'
  - 'token'


## Game Dynamics and Rules (TwoPileNim)

- The grid encodes a two-pile Nim position using **two token columns** (two vertical stacks of `'token'`).
- **Each pile corresponds to one column**: the number of `'token'` cells in that column is the pile size.
- The game is **turn-based**. On each agent turn, the policy selects exactly one action `(row, col)`.

### Action meaning
- The action `(row, col)` indicates choosing **pile `col`** and removing tokens according to the selected **row**.
- A move is legal only if the selected `(row, col)` corresponds to a location in a token-stack column that results in removing **at least one** token from that pile.
- Intuitively: selecting a cell in a pile column removes tokens **from that cell and all tokens “below it” in the same column** (i.e., it reduces the pile to the tokens strictly above the selected cell).  
  - Selecting higher rows removes fewer tokens; selecting lower rows removes more tokens.

### Terminal condition and winner
- The game ends when **no `'token'` cells remain in the grid** (both piles are empty).
- The player who makes the move that leaves the grid with **no remaining tokens** wins (standard normal-play Nim).

### Optimal play objective
- The optimal strategy is the standard Nim strategy: on your turn, make a move that leaves the opponent a **losing position** (for two piles, this corresponds to leaving the piles with **equal sizes**, when possible).

--

## Action semantics

- The policy must return a tuple (row, col) corresponding to a valid cell location in the grid. The returned action (row, col) should mean: col -> which pile, row -> how many tokens to remove.
- Selecting a cell represents choosing that cell as the agent’s action.
- The environment defines which actions are legal and how selecting a cell affects the game state.
- Selecting a cell that does not correspond to a legal action has no effect.

## Action Interpretation (Click Semantics)

In this environment, actions are expressed by selecting (clicking) a cell in the grid.
The meaning of a click is environment-dependent and is interpreted by the environment,
not by the policy itself.

The policy does NOT directly specify movement directions, rule logic, or outcomes.
It only selects a grid cell, and the environment determines the resulting effect.

### Click Semantics (TwoPileNim)

- Clicking a cell containing a 'token' selects that pile and removes tokens.
- The column of the clicked cell determines which pile is chosen.
- The row of the clicked cell determines how many tokens are removed.
- Clicking an empty cell has no effect.
- All turn-taking and win conditions are handled by the environment.

## Task Description
Task:
Play the game optimally and win by forcing the opponent into a losing position.
The policy should follow the optimal Nim strategy whenever possible.

## Expert-Derived Hints

Below is a consolidated description of the agent’s demonstrated decision-making strategy, inferred from multiple expert trajectories. The statements summarize consistent behaviors observed across rollouts and are intended to guide policy synthesis, not to prescribe explicit rules or primitives.

## Output Format Constraint

Return ONLY the Python code for the policy, wrapped in a Markdown fenced code block
that starts with ```python and ends with ```.

The code must define a function with the following signature:

```python
def policy(obs):
    ...
    return action
```

Where `action` is:
- a tuple (row, col)

You may define helper functions inside the code.
Do not use external libraries.
Do not include explanations, comments, or markdown.
Return only executable Python code.
Do not include any text outside the code block.

## Notes on Nim Assumptions

- No Nim-specific helper functions are provided.
- The policy must infer pile structure directly from the grid observation.
- The policy selects actions by choosing grid cells; all legality, turn-taking, and termination logic is handled by the environment.
